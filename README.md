# Warwick+ Film Database — Custom Data Structures Implementation

A high-performance film database backend implemented from scratch using custom data structures, developed as part of CS126: Design of Information Structures at the University of Warwick.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced understanding of fundamental computer science concepts by implementing a complete film database system using only custom-built data structures. The system manages three core entities — Movies, Credits, and Ratings — with optimized query performance and memory efficiency.

**Key Achievement:** Achieved 22x performance improvement (2800ms → 125ms) through strategic data structure design and algorithmic optimization.

## Technical Implementation

### Custom Data Structures

**MyHashTable**: A chaining-based hash table implementation providing O(1) average-case lookup, insertion, and deletion operations. Features collision resolution through linked list chaining and optimized for integer key hashing.

**MyDynamicArray**: A resizable array implementation with automatic capacity management, providing O(1) random access and amortized O(1) insertion. Implements efficient memory management with strategic resizing policies.

### Architecture Highlights

- **Constraint-Driven Design**: Built without Java Collections framework to demonstrate deep understanding of fundamental data structures
- **Performance-First Approach**: Achieved near-constant time operations for core database queries
- **Memory Efficiency**: Optimized storage with sparse data representation and intelligent resizing
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture supports efficient handling of large datasets

## System Architecture

### Movies Store

- **Primary Structure**: `MyHashTable<Integer, Movie>` for O(1) movie lookup by ID
- **Secondary Structure**: `MyDynamicArray<Integer>` for efficient iteration and search operations
- **Key Features**: Generic field access methods, collection management, production company tracking
- **Performance**: Constant-time movie retrieval, linear-time search operations

### Credits Store

- **Primary Structure**: `MyHashTable<Integer, CreditRecord>` for film-to-credits mapping
- **Global Indexes**: Separate dynamic arrays for unique cast and crew members
- **Key Features**: Duplicate prevention, billing order management, cross-film queries
- **Performance**: O(1) credit lookup, efficient global people searches

### Ratings Store

- **Dual Indexing**: Two hash tables for bidirectional queries
  - `movieID → ratings[]` for movie-based analytics
  - `userID → ratings[]` for user-based analytics
- **Key Features**: Rating aggregation, user behavior analysis, movie popularity metrics
- **Performance**: O(1) rating access from both movie and user perspectives

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

- Java 21 or higher
- Gradle (or use the included wrapper)

### Build and Test

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Gh110ost007/Warwick-Application.git
cd Warwick-Application

# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run tests
./gradlew test

# Run the application

```

## Key Design Decisions

### Data Structure Choices

- **Hash Tables**: Chosen for O(1) average lookup time, essential for ID-based queries
- **Dynamic Arrays**: Selected for automatic resizing and O(1) random access
- **Dual Indexing**: Ratings store uses two hash tables for efficient bidirectional queries

### Code Quality

- **DRY Principle**: Generic `getField()` methods eliminate repetitive null-checking
- **Consistent Error Handling**: Standardized return values for missing data
- **Clear Separation**: Hash tables for lookup, dynamic arrays for iteration

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive JUnit tests covering:

- Store functionality (add, remove, get operations)
- Edge cases (null values, invalid IDs)
- Performance benchmarks
- Data integrity checks

Run tests with:

```bash
./gradlew test
```
